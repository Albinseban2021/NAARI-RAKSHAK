This app consists of Login and Register screen to register yourself in the app, apart from this it contain registernumber activity to register your emergency contact number and after registering your contact number you can share your current location to your emergency contact only just by shaking your phone a little bit !!
It also has emergency call numbers like student helpline number, police or if you are getting domestically abused by someone then you can directly call on that numbers only just by clicking  on a button.
One feature is also there which is fake ringtone button , after pressing on that button your phone will start ringing and it'll play your phone's ringtone.
It's a very good app for anyone walking alone in nights they just have to start service and shake his/her phone in case of emergency , rest work is done by the app. There is no need of internet connection in this app ,it'll share your current location via normal message.
